# Iab207 Assessment Three Website

The info contained here will help if you get stuck with navigating the site. It was our intention that this would be as intuative as possible but we are still learning and it may not be super clear from an outside perspective how to navigate the website. 

At the time of writing the site is uploaded onto heroku utilising persistant postgresql database functionality. Our event card images tend to break on their own for some unexplained reason over time. This appears to be a heroku issue as they funtion fine locally. 

1. In order to log in an account must be created. This means navigating to the log in|register button on the top right of the website. From there at the bottom of the log in form you will see a register link. Click that to be taken to the account registration form. Register an account here by providing the required information (the phone number must start be of the format 4XXXXXXXX)

2. You can now navigate back to the login page and log into your account. 

3. From here you can access new functionality within the navigation bar, such as creating events (create event), viewing your owned events (myevents), and viewing events you have booked (booked events, NOTE not in CRA limited funtionality at this time). 
3.1. After creating an event you can navigate to the myevents page and click on the drop down menu featured on each event card. Here you will find buttons to update, delete and view said events. 

4. Events that you or other users have created can be seen on the main index page, certain keywords can be searched or the events can be filtered by musical genre

I beleive that covers most of the uses currently featured for the website. I hope you enjoy it and it flow wells. Thanks for reading.
